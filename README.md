Pick a number between 1 and 500

When the program starts, it's first guess will be 250. The first input of each round is whether it is correct or not.

1 - Incorrect

0 - Correct

If correct, it will output your number, then end.

If not, then you can specify whether your number was higher or lower than the guessed number

The program then will calculate a new guess
